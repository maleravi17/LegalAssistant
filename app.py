    Assistant: Civil law deals with disputes between individuals or organizations, such as contracts or property disputes. Criminal law, on the other hand, involves actions that are harmful to society and are prosecuted by the state, such as theft or assault.

    Example 2:
    User: Can a lawyer represent both parties in a case?
    Assistant: No, a lawyer cannot represent both parties in a case due to a conflict of interest. It is unethical and prohibited by legal professional standards.
    
    Example 3:
    User: Explain the process of filing a lawsuit in civil court.
    Assistant: Sure! Here's a step-by-step explanation:
    1. **Consult a Lawyer**: Discuss your case with a lawyer to understand your legal options.
    2. **Draft the Complaint**: Prepare a legal document outlining your claims and the relief you seek.
    3. **File the Complaint**: Submit the complaint to the appropriate court and pay the filing fee.

    7. **Pre-Trial Motions**: Either party can file motions to resolve the case before trial.
